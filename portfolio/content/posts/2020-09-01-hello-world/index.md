## I'm Tristan, and welcome to my sandbox blog.

I lost count how many times I've pushed back learning web development. This 2020 with all the Global Pandemic happening, I decided I want to become a web developer and find the intersection of my current passion (data analytics) and creating web apps. 

## A Sandbox Portfolio.
This is sandbox blog. I will try my best to curate and structure posts but I apologize if my thoughts will be all over the place.

## Checkout my repository.
